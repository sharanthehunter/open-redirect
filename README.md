# open-redirect

Hey folks, today I came with an open redirect vulnerability bug.

First I started to enumerate all the subdomains using sublist3r tool.Then I sorted out the live subdomains.

I found showroom.ind**mart.com

In other tab I was running web.archive.org to list all URLâ€™s of our target.

https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=*.target.com/*&collapse=urlkey&output=text&fl=original

It was listing n number of urls.I started to search for that particular subdomain(showroom.ind**mart.com)

At last I ended with this url :)

https://showroom.ind**mart.com/glpcat/demo.php?url=

It has a url= parameter



I opened my browser and changed the url parameter to my burp collaborator client url

Boom!!!

It was redirecting to my collab url. I got the response in the collab

Using this I was able to do a open redirect to any websiteâ€¦
